,,,,"Ugh… my head. Where… am I? I feel like I'm burning up…"
,,,,"The restaurant. I gotta get back… to the restaurant."
EndScenario
*ZeroRoomReachArea
,satan,,charR,"Well, look who fell through the floorboards of the universe. Welcome to Hell's Kitchen — and no, not the TV show, we're currently suing them for copyright."
,player,,charL,"What's going on here? Am I being filmed? Who are you?"
,satan,,charR,"I wish! But the union is striking right now for fair wages. Can you believe it?!"
,player,,charL,"Union?"
,satan,,charR,"Yep. Even in Hell, you gotta pay your dues."
,satan,,charR,"As for me? I think even you can figure that out. The big ""L""? The horribly-misunderstood-but-you-can't-help-but-root-for-him fallen angel?"
,player,,charL,"You're… The Devil? So there really is a God?"
,satan,,charR,"God! All anyone wants to talk about is that old geezer. Everyone loves to hate mean old Satan, but way more people have been killed in the name of the big G than little old me."
,player,,charL,"..."
,player,,charL,"I'm dead…?"
,satan,,charR,"Oh, cheer up, buttercup! Don't think too hard about it for now. Alright, that's enough explaining from me. You can move, so you can work."
,player,,charL,"You haven't explained anything yet! How did I die? Who even am I? Why can't I remember?"
,satan,,charR,"Yeah yeah, file a complaint with the union. Moving on. Head in to the next room and say hi to Stan for me."
EndScenario
*FirstRoomIntro
,satan,,charR,"Ah, Stan! It's been too long. How've you been, my friend?"
,stan,,charM,"AAAAAAH, IT BURNS. MY EYES. MY FACE. OH GOD HELP ME"
,satan,,charR,"Sounds like someone's hungry! Go to the counter and take their order with E."
,player,,charL,"Uhhh, they don't sound hungry to-"
,satan,,charR,"Be polite! You're here to serve them, and it better be with a smile!"
,satan,,charR,"See that in the top left of your screen? That's the order. Now get cooking. Serve the dish to the guest before they get hangry — and by hangry, I mean they'll start removing your limbs alphabetically."
EndScenario
*SecondRoomIngredients
,satan,,charR,"Now, pick up that soul on the floor. Don't think about why it's screaming. Just press E to grab it."
,player,,charL,"Why-"
,satan,,charR,"I said don't think about it."
,satan,,charR,"Lovely. Be careful, they bite. Drop it with Q before you lose an arm."
,player,,charL,"You just told me to drop it."
,satan,,charR,"Yeah, and I'm telling you to pick it up again."
,satan,,charR,"Now listen here. You work for me now. You're going to be my chef at my little diner I've opened up."
,player,,charL,"A diner. I think I always wanted to open a diner."
,satan,,charR,"Oh, I'm sure you did."
EndScenario
*ThirdRoomDarkness
,satan,,charR,"Oh good. The all-consuming darkness is awake. Coworkers, amirite?"
,player,,charL,"I'm not scared of the dark."
,satan,,charR,"Maybe you should be."
,player,,charL,"Ah! Why does it feel like my head's being stabbed with needles?!"
,satan,,charR,"Nothing like a practical lesson. If you stay in the darkness for too long, it'll slowly consume your being and consciousness until you're an empty husk."
,player,,charL,"Okay, maybe I'm a little scared of the dark."
,satan,,charR,"Don't worry, I'll drag you back as many times as I need. That said, it doesn't mean you can just run around all willy-nilly. Death can be painful, and I will make it painful, just for you."
EndScenario
*FourthRoomLightGun
,satan,,charR,"Since I'm the best boss around, here's a nifty little device to ward off the darkness. Use your left mouse button to shoot. The bullets create light — your only defense down here."
,player,,charL,"You're just giving this to me? Aren't you worried I'm going to… y'know."
,satan,,charR,"That's not just any gunpowder rifle. That's God's Little Shotgun! It'll be fine. Besides, if you die, I'll just bring you right back! Dying is too easy of an escape."
,player,,charL,"God's little what-"
,satan,,charR,"Anyways! Go forth and get more ingredients!"
,player,,charL,"What the hell is that?!"
,satan,,charR,"Oh, just another soul of the damned. You can use your light gun to defeat them."
,player,,charL,"I thought they were already dead."
,satan,,charR,"You're dead too, in case you forgot. Yet here you are, wasting my valuable time that could be spent on winning that lawsuit!"
EndScenario
*CookingTutorial
,satan,,charR,"Head back to the pot and we'll cook something up for that starving customer."
,player,,charL,"A pot? What am I, a witch?"
,satan,,charR,"Maybe a witch with a B."
,satan,,charR,"Select the dish you want to make and click ""COOK"""
,satan,,charR,"You need to press the buttons in the order shown to complete the dish. The buttons are WASD and your arrow keys. If you mess up, you have to start over. Our customers deserve perfection."
,satan,,charR,"Don't forget to add love. Or just bash it in until it stops moving. Either works."
,player,,charL,"Is there any salt I can add? Or… any non-screaming ingredients?"
,satan,,charR,"Ugh. Cry me a river. You're so needy!"
,satan,,charR,"You'll earn money from these culinary crimes. Use it to buy power-ups and items from the shop. Some might even be useful."
,player,,charL,"Wait, there's money? What do you even need money for?"
,satan,,charR,"That's Capitalism, baby! Do all that right, and you might live long enough to make it to your next shift. Mess it up… and congratulations, you'll be the next special on the menu."
,player,,charL,"So, what? I'm just supposed to throw crap in a Witch's cauldron for all eternity? I don't even remember what I'm being punished for!"
,satan,,charR,"Punishment? This is much, much more than a punishment. Besides, who said it was eternal?"
,player,,charL,"I don't understand. If I'm not being punished, and I'm not here forever, then what's the point?"
,satan,,charR,"Ugh, you humans. Why does everything need to have a ""point""? Look. All you gotta do is survive the week. 5 days, 40 hours, the American way. Get to the end, and we'll talk."
