ACT 0 - TUTORIAL
SCENE: THE START
(Crackling of fire starts quiet, builds up until a loud crash. Everything goes silent. Fade from black)
(Theo's POV, from laying down to sitting up and seeing the wall.)
SFX: Fire crackling, hell noises
THEO
Ugh… my head. Where… am I? I feel like I’m burning up…
THEO
I can see someone through the fog ahead… This isn’t right… Where’s… the restaurant..?
SCENE: TUTORIAL INTRO ROOM
SATAN
Well, look who’s up and walking! Welcome to Hell’s Kitchen — and no, not the TV show, we’re currently suing them for copyright.
THEO
Agh! What’s going on here? Am I being filmed? Who are you?
SATAN
I wish! But the union is striking right now for fair wages. Can you believe it?!
THEO
Union?
SATAN
Yep. Even in Hell, you gotta pay your dues.
THEO
Hell?! So, then you’re—
SATAN
The big “L”? The horribly-misunderstood-but-you-can’t-help-but-root-for-him fallen angel?
THEO
So, there really is a God. And that means…
SATAN
God! Kids these days, it’s all greater deities and bad hot takes. Eternal damnation just doesn’t fit into a 7-second video!
THEO
...
THEO
...I’m dead…?
SATAN
Don’t think too hard about it for now. Alright, that’s enough explaining from me. Time to work!
THEO
You haven’t explained anything yet! How did I die? Why can’t I remember?
SATAN
Yeah yeah, file a complaint with the union. Moving on. Get going to the next room, and say hi to Stan for me.
SCENE: FIRST ROOM (GET ORDERS)
(A customer glows.)
SATAN
Ah, Stan! It’s been too long. How’ve you been, my friend?
STAN
AAAAAAH, IT BURNS. MY EYES. MY FACE. OH GOD HELP ME
SATAN
Sounds like someone’s hungry! See that in the top left of your screen? That’s Stan’s order. Now you’ve gotta gather all 3 ingredients.
THEO
Uhhh, they don’t sound hungry to—
SATAN
And do it quickly unless you want your limbs removed algebraically-
STAN
OH. OH GOD. MY ARM. MY ARM IS UNSCREWING. WHYYYY?!
SATAN
Hmm, or was it alphabetically? Either way, you get the point. Speed is key when serving the customer!
THEO
(This guy’s clearly nuts, devil or not. But, I guess I have no choice but to play along for now…)
(Open door to second room.)
SCENE: SECOND ROOM (COLLECT INGREDIENTS)
(Arrow points to direction of ingredients.)
SATAN
Now, go grab food from the fridge. Don’t think about why it’s screaming. Just press E on the fridge to take food out of it.
THEO
Why—
SATAN
I said don’t think about it.
SCENE: GATHERED INGREDIENT
SATAN
You can press Q to drop items if you’re feeling encumbered. Just remember you can’t pick them back up!
SCENE: THIRD ROOM (DARKNESS)
(Theo goes into the dark room.)
THEO
Why’s this room so dark?
SATAN
Meet your coworker, all-consuming darkness. All-consuming darkness, meet your new best friend.
THEO
...
SATAN
What, scared of the dark? Get moving!
(Player takes damage from the darkness.)
SCENE: DARKNESS DAMAGE
THEO
Agh! It feels like little needles in my head… What is that?!
SATAN
Hey, I did say it was all-consuming. Make sure to stick to the light if you want to keep your everything.
THEO
(Okay, maybe I’m a little scared of the dark.)
SATAN
Don’t worry, even if you’re consumed, I’ll drag you back as many times as I need.
THEO
(What’s the point of any of this?! Is this just to torture me? What did I do to deserve all this?!)
SCENE: FOURTH ROOM (LIGHT GUN)
(Satan gives the player the light gun.)
SATAN
Since I’m the best boss around, here’s a nifty little device to ward off the darkness. 
THEO
So, you want me to fire a gun into a small, dark, enclosed room? Awesome torture tactic.
SATAN
You’ve got it all wrong!  That’s God’s Little Shotgun! The bullets create light — your only defense down here.
SATAN
Click the left button to shoot a projectile to ward off the dark! No reload needed, it’ll recharge over time automatically!
THEO
God’s little what now—
SATAN
Anyways! Go forth and get more ingredients! Just one more before you can cook!
SCENE: GATHERED INGREDIENT
THEO
What the hell are those things?!
SATAN
Oh, just some souls of the damned. You can use your light gun to defeat them.
THEO
I thought they were already dead.
SATAN
You’re dead too, in case you forgot. Yet here you are, wasting my valuable time that could be spent on winning that lawsuit! 
THEO
(There’s no point in arguing with him… He clearly doesn’t care what I say.)
SATAN
Just get back to the cauldron, I’ve got an affidavit to forge.
SCENE: TIME TO COOK
(The player approaches the cauldron.)
SATAN
For your pain, let me read you the manual. Don’t say I never did nothing for you, capiche? 
THEO
What?
SATAN
Let’s see here… “Select your dish and click COOK. You must then complete the incantation”... blah blah… boring… skipping… Ah! Here.
SATAN
“You need to press the buttons in the order shown to complete the dish. The buttons are WASD and your arrow key.”
SATAN
By the way, if you mess up, you have to start over. Our customers deserve perfection, Theo. Perfection!
THEO
Right… Guess I’ll just give it a shot, then.
(Complete dish.)
SCENE: COOKING COMPLETE
SATAN
You’ll earn money from these culinary crimes, by the by. Use it to buy cool power-ups and items from the shop.
THEO
Wait, there’s money? What do you even need money for?
SATAN
Aha, that’s Capitalism, baby! Just do your little job, and I’ll worry about the rest.
THEO
So, what? My eternal punishment is to throw crap in a cauldron for all eternity? Why me, why all of this?!
SATAN
Punishment? This is much, much more than a punishment. Besides, who said it was eternal?
THEO
I don’t understand. If I’m not being punished, and I’m not here forever, then what’s the point?
SATAN
Ugh, you humans. Why does everything need to have a “point”? Look. All you gotta do is survive the week. 5 days, 40 hours, the American way. 
THEO
Only a week? But why? Is this some kind of test, then?

SATAN
Save the game theory for the professionals, okay? Just get to the end of the week, and we’ll talk.
