Start of Game
Crackling of fire starts quiet, builds up until a loud crash. Everything goes silent. Fade from black
Theo pov, from laying down to sitting up and seeing the wall
SFX: Fire crackling, hell noises
Waking Up
Theo:
“Ugh… my head. Where… am I? I feel like I’m burning up…” 
Theo:
“The restaurant. I gotta get back… to the restaurant.”
“Tutorial: Welcome to Your First Shift”
Intro Room
Satan:
 “Well, look who’s up and walking! Welcome to Hell’s Kitchen — and no, not the TV show, we’re currently suing them for copyright.”
Theo:
“What’s going on here? Am I being filmed? Who are you?”
Satan: 
“I wish! But the union is striking right now for fair wages. Can you believe it?!”
Theo:
“Union?”
Satan:
“Yep. Even in Hell, you gotta pay your dues.”
Theo:
“Hell?! So, then you’re-”
Satan:
“The big “L”? The horribly-misunderstood-but-you-can’t-help-but-root-for-him fallen angel?” 
Theo:
“So, there really is a God. And that means…”
Satan: 
“God! Kids these days, it’s all greater deities and angry British men to them. Eternal damnation just doesn’t fit into a 7 second video!”
Theo:
“...”
“I’m dead…?”
Satan :
 “Don’t think too hard about it for now. Alright, that’s enough explaining from me. You can move, so you can work. ”
Theo
“You haven’t explained anything yet! How did I die? Why can’t I remember?”
Satan:
“Yeah yeah, file a complaint with the union. Moving on. Get going to the next room, and say hi to Stan for me.”
First room: Get orders from customers
[Customer glows]
Satan:
 “Ah, Stan! It’s been too long. How’ve you been, my friend?”
Stan:
“AAAAAAH, IT BURNS. MY EYES. MY FACE. OH GOD HELP ME”
Satan:
“Sounds like someone’s hungry! See that in the top left of your screen? That’s Stan’s order. Now you’ve gotta gather all 3 ingredients. ”
Theo:
“Uhhh, they don’t sound hungry to-”
Satan:
 “And do it quickly before the customer gets hangry — and by hangry, I mean they’ll start removing your limbs alphabetically.”
Open door to second room
Second room: Collect Ingredients
Arrow points to direction of ingredients
Satan:
 “Now, go grab food from the fridge. Don’t think about why it’s screaming. Just press E on the fridge to take food out of it.”
Theo:
“Why-”
Satan:
“I said don’t think about it.”
Second room: Gathered Ingredient
Satan:
“You can press Q to drop it on the ground  if you’re feeling encumbered. Don’t worry about being unsanitary, I sent all Health Inspectors to Superhell forever ago.”
Third Room: Darkness
[Theo goes into the dark room]
Theo:
“Why’s this room so dark?”
Satan:
“Meet your coworker, all-consuming darkness. All-consuming darkness, meet your new best friend.”
Theo:
“...”
Satan:
“What, scared of the dark? Get moving!”
player takes damage from the darkness
Third Room: Darkness Damage
Theo:
“Ah! Why does it feel like my head’s being stabbed with needles?!”
Satan:
“Nothing like a practical lesson. If you stay in the darkness for too long, it’ll slowly consume your being and consciousness until you’re an empty husk.”
Theo:
“Okay, maybe I’m a little scared of the dark.”
Satan:
“Don’t worry, I’ll drag you back as many times as I need.”
Fourth room: Light Gun
Satan gives player the light gun
Satan:
“Since I’m the best boss around, here’s a nifty little device to ward off the darkness. Use your left mouse button to shoot. The bullets create light — your only defense down here.”
Theo:
“You’re just giving this to me? Aren’t you worried I’m going to… y’know.”
Satan:
“That’s not just any gunpowder rifle. That’s God’s Little Shotgun! It’ll be fine. Besides, if you die, I’ll just bring you right back! Dying is too easy of an escape.”
Theo:
“God’s little what-”
Satan:
“Anyways! Go forth and get more ingredients!”
Fourth Room: Gathered Ingredient
Theo:
“What the hell are those things?!”
Satan:
“Oh, just some souls of the damned. You can use your light gun to defeat them.”
Theo:
“I thought they were already dead.”
Satan:
“You’re dead too, in case you forgot. Yet here you are, wasting my valuable time that could be spent on winning that lawsuit!”
Satan
“Just get back to the cauldron, I’ve got an affidavit to forge.”
[The player approaches the cauldron.]
Time to cook
Satan:
“For your pain, let me read you the manual. Don’t say I never did nothing for you, capiche? Let’s see here… 
Satan:
“Select the dish you want to make and click COOK. You must then complete the incantation”... let’s see, flip to page 20018… Ah! Here.”
Satan:
“You need to press the buttons in the order shown to complete the dish. The buttons are WASD and your arrow keys. If you mess up, you have to start over. Our customers deserve perfection.”
Satan:
 “You’re welcome. Don’t forget to add some love, by the way. Or just bash it in until it stops moving. Either works.”
Theo
“Great… Guess I’ll just give it a shot, then.”
[Complete dish]
Cooking Complete
Satan:
 “You’ll earn money from these culinary crimes, by the by. Use it to buy power-ups and items from the shop. Some might even be useful.”
Theo:
“Wait, there’s money? What do you even need money for?”
Satan:
 “That’s Capitalism, baby! Just do your little job, and I’ll worry about the rest.”
Theo:
“So, what? I’m just supposed to throw crap in a Witch’s cauldron for all eternity? I don’t even remember what I’m being punished for!”
Satan:
 “Punishment? This is much, much more than a punishment. Besides, who said it was eternal?”
Theo:
“I don’t understand. If I’m not being punished, and I’m not here forever, then what’s the point?”
Satan:
 “Ugh, you humans. Why does everything need to have a “point”? Look. All you gotta do is survive the week. 5 days, 40 hours, the American way. Get to the end, and we’ll talk.”
A Choice
In front of the player, in large letters on the wall: Was [name] a good person? Yes/No
Theo:
“[Name]? I’ve heard that name before.  But… I can’t remember…”
Go to the no door: “If they have to ask, they were probably an asshole.”
Go to the yes door: “If their name is on a wall, then they’re probably important.”
Doors both lead to the kitchen and tutorial starts

Theo:
“A VIP? Why would someone important come to a diner?”
Satan:
 “Hey, I’ll have you know this place BOTH the Michelin’s!”
Theo:
“You mean Michelin Stars?”
Satan:

In the regular storage room, the wall to the hidden room is open for the player to interact with. Going through the door triggers the hidden room events.

Theo
“Huh?”
Satan
“Just keep making food, food man. That’s all you need to know, right?”
Act 2 - Bank Vault
During Day 3

There is a manager desk with a name plate that says “Theodore” with the last name scratched out
Theo
“This place reminds me of my father. He was a bank manager, investor, the whole everything. He was good at what he did. Eventually, he gave me money to “invest in my future” or whatever.”
VIP2 appears at the gambling table.
Theo
“Time to try my luck.”

question: did theo deserve a legacy?
Go back to the diner
Satan

Aftershift between 4 and 5
Environment is the main diner but brighter
Theo
“I could have sworn I went into a different room. Did I somehow get turned around back to the diner?
“But the smell is different. In the regular diner, nothing smells. Probably because everything is burning they can’t put out a scent.”
Menu reads “Theo’s Diner”
Theo
“I remember spending my days with my grandad in a place like this. I was always put on the register because he didn’t trust me around the food until I was older.”
Challenge: like the main cooking minigame but do not do the cooking sequence

Child model moves between the register and other stations
Theo
“You’re always in the way! Move!”
After [X] number of orders and [Time] has passed, everything suddenly comes to a stop
Theo
“I can’t take it. I was promised that this place would basically print money for me. But all it’s been is loss after loss!”

father, son, unholy spirit
Question: Did Theo deserve 
After getting back to the diner
Satan
“Well, look who came back. You look less…burnt…than I remember.”
Theo
“You set this up, didn’t you?”
Satan
“Do what, now?”
Theo
“You know what I’m talking about. The storage rooms. This is your place, you put them there.”
Satan
“Even if I did, so what? What are you going to do about it?”
Theo
“I-”
Satan
“Come on. You have one more day left. Then you can leave.”
